# foundation4joomla
A Joomla 3.x template based on Zurb's foundation

#About me

As a designer/developer of (mainly) Joomla websites I'm always looking at ways to improve my workflow. In the 18 years I've been designing and developing websites I've worked from scratch, build my own cms, started using Joomla (1.5), worked with Wordpress, went back to Joomla, used commercial templates from template clubs like JoomlaXtc, Yootheme, JoomlArt and several others.... I loved the nice out of the box look from commercial templates, but always had to throw away a lot from the initial template because my clients didn't have the content to fill all that...

#Why foundation for Joomla 

Since a few years I'm back to building templates for Joomla 3.x from scratch... that is, I start with Zurb's Foundation. Why not bootstrap? I'm pigheaded and don't want to follow the crowd... and beside that, I found dat Foundation makes more sense to me, has a beautifull and well documented resource website (http://foundation.zurb.com) and allows me to build websites that score above 80% on PageSpeed and Yslow... 

#About this repository

This repository contains my starting point template... It's an installable Joomla template with foundation at it's base. I use the SASS options for my CSS, but if you are not familiar with that, you can just edit the .css files. More on SASS and Foundation you can find on the foundation website: http://foundation.zurb.com!
